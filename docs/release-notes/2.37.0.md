## Release Highlights


### Improved Inventory presentation

**Introduction**

This release of PMM starts the series of improvements related to Services and Node presentations inside PMM. The goal will be to provide users with precise and valuable Inventory data of objects added into PMM.

**Problem to solve**

The Inventory in PMM represented the database structure we used to store inventory information and had no additional value for the users. 

Finding and understanding the relationship between components (Services, Nodes, Agents) in PMM and their parameters took a lot of work.

Inventory also was an independent and not connected part of the PMM on UI, while it's the center of all features provided by PMM.

**Current solution** 

We are now releasing only the first step of the improvements on Inventory. The goal is to start the process, show the direction we plan to go with this and start making Inventory the starting point to use and explore other features of the PMM.

\[IMAGE OF NEW INVENTORY, Services tab\]

This first iteration of Inventory will provide the following:

*   Clear _design interface_ for the information. 
*   _Database status_. This information is based on the monitoring metrics. It will let you quickly see the status of the Database when you are working with Inventory.  
*   _Monitoring status p_rovides a summarized status of the monitoring agents related to this Service. Will let users spot problems with Agents and how the PMM monitoring the Service
*   _Detailed information_ provides access to additional parameters and labels of the Services and does not overload the main list simultaneously. 
*   Links to _related_ Service Summary _Dashboards_ or _QueryAnalytics_ results help simplify access to the related PMM sections. 

**What's next**

In the subsequent releases, we are planning to continue improvements in the Invenrory in two extensive directions: 

*   We are improving the presentation of Services and nodes by adding more features like filtering and interconnection between Services and nodes.
*   Structured/clustered presentation of the Services. To let PMM users see their Services organized in clusters and operate on a Cluster level instead of individual Services.

### New Experimental Dashboards for Kubernetes Monitoring

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important"
    These experimental dashboards are subject to change. It is recommended to use these dashboards for testing purposes only.


We are pleased to announce the release of PMM V2.37, which introduces three new experimental dashboards:

- Kubernetes Cluster Summary
- Kubernetes Pods Status
- Kubernetes Volumes 

These dashboards are designed to provide valuable insights into the status and performance of your Kubernetes cluster, pods, and volumes, helping you to identify and troubleshoot issues quickly and easily.

We welcome your feedback as we continue to enhance PMM with these new dashboards.


**Experimental Kubernetes Cluster Summary Dashboard**

*Kubernetes Cluster Summary* provides a comprehensive overview of your Kubernetes cluster, including:

- Components
- Node
- Pod
- PVC status
- CPU
- Memory overview, and more. 

This dashboard displays all workloads running in the cluster, enabling you to take action and optimize its performance.

**Experimental Kubernetes Pods Status Dashboard**

*Kubernetes Pods Status dashboard* provides detailed information about the state and performance of your pods, including CPU, Memory, and Network metrics. 

This dashboard can help you quickly pinpoint any issues affecting your pods and ensure they continue to operate smoothly.

**Experimental Kubernetes Volume Dashboard**

*Kubernetes Volumes* dashboard  provides insights into your Kubernetes volumes, including capacity and usage, in real-time. With this dashboard, you can easily monitor the performance and usage of your volumes and take proactive measures to ensure their performance.

To learn more about these new experimental dashboards and how to use them, refer to the [documentation](). 


Here are the steps to create a new folder and move all experimental dashboards to the new folder for quick access and internal use:

!!! note alert alert-primary "Note"
    You should have at least an *Editor* role to create a new folder and move all experimental dashbaords.

1.	Navigate to the **Main** menu and hover on the {{icon.dashboards}} _PMM Dashboards_ **Dashboards** icon.
2.	Click **New folder**.
3.	Provide a name for your folder, and then select **Create**.
4.	Navigate to {{icon.dashboards}} _PMM Dashboards_ **Dashboards** from the **Main** menu and click **Browse**.
5.  Select the dashboard that you want to move and click **Move**.
6.	On the **Choose Dashboard** dialogue box, from the dropdown under **Folder** option, choose the folder where you want to move the dashboard.
7.	To apply your changes, select **Save Dashboard**.

## New Features

<!---

- List of new features with a comprehensive description of the feature and link to the JIRA ticket.

    Example:
    
    [PMM-XXXX](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-XXXX) - Comprehensive description.

--->

- [PMM-10913](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10913) - Starting with PMM 2.37.0, you can use an external PostgreSQL server as a data storage for PMM. Thus, even if PMM fails, your data will be stored in an external source, reducing the risk associated with data loss. Furthermore, clustered PostgreSQL instances also enhance performance.

- [PMM-11281](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11281) - We have written a query for the postgres exporter to deal with lock conflicts in databases that block several transactions, thus impacting performance. With this query, you can find the PID of the blocking session and how many sessions it blocked. The proactive approach enables customers to address non-responsive databases quickly by understanding the underlying causes.

- [PMM-11384](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11384) - PMM 2.37.0 now supports PSMDB operator version 1.13.

- [PMM-11438](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11438) - Starting with PMM 2.37.0, PMM administrators can disable the internal PostgreSQL server, which helps to fine-tune the server.

- [PMM-11439](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11439) - Starting with PMM 2.37.0, a PMM administrator can now view metrics from an external PostgreSQL server.

- [PMM-11675](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11675) - Telemetry with external PostgreSQL

- [PMM-11834](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11834) - PMM 2.37.0 now supports PSMDB 1.14 operator.



## Improvements

- [PMM-4466](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4466) - We have migrated Grafana to use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite, which enhances the performance of the Auth system and sessions and makes the system less complex.
- [PMM-11412](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11412) - We have enhanced our dashboards to be more user-oriented, displaying the DB cluster's status along with its components, such as metrics of stateful, pods, and so on. Also, you can apply filters based on DB name or DB type.
- [PMM-11832](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11832) - Inconsistent subcategories
- [[PMM-11522](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11522) - Advisors - better telemetry
- [[PMM-11544](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11544) - Unable to view EXPLAIN output for a query
- [PMM-11926](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11926) - Subscription page - link improvement
