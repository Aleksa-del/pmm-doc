## Release Highlights

###  Access Control: Limit access to metrics

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important/Caution"
    Disclaimer:  PMM Access Control is still technical preview and is subject to change. We recommend that early adopters use this feature for testing purposes only.

Starting with PMM 2.35.0, we are excited to announce the first step towards PMM Access Management, a highly anticipated solution by our users. With this solution, PMM allows you to manage who has access to metrics based on labels. This new feature provides a standardized method for granting, changing, and revoking access to metrics. With the introduction of label-based access control, you can now establish roles that control which data can be queried based on specific label criteria. It allows you to associate multiple sets of individual Prometheus (Victoria Metics) labels with a role, ensuring that queries will only return data from series that meet the defined labels. This provides you with a powerful and flexible way to manage your data and ensure secure access to the information you need. For more information, visit the Access Control documentation.


###  GA: Deployment of PMM in kubernetes with Helm Chart

We are happy to announce the General Availability of PMM deployment in Kubernetes with the Helm chart. PMM deployment via Helm chart in Kubernetes has been available as Tech Preview since PMM v2.29, but now we're delighted to offer it to users as a fully supported feature. For more information, see [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/setting-up/server/helm.html).  

###  DBaaS: Backup schedule while creating DB clusters

Starting with PMM 2.35.0, you can add a backup schedule while creating DB clusters in DBaaS. This feature is a fusion of Backup management and DBaaS in PMM. Currently, DBaaS only supports scheduled backups, which can only be enabled when a database cluster is created.

!!! note alert alert-primary "Note"
    DBaaS does not support on-demand backups.

###  DBaaS: Restore cluster from backup stored on S3

You can now restore a cluster from backup stored on S3 while creating DB clusters in DBaaS. Currently, you cannot restore a cluster from a backup. You can just create a database cluster from backup.

!!! note alert alert-primary "Note"
    DBaaS does not support on-demand-restore.

### Backup Management for MongoDB

In this release, we are adding missing pieces for better troubleshooting the Backup/Restore process. PMM will now be checking the presence of the backup tool on the Database server and verifying its versions for compatibility to void executions when the result is not successful. 

We also improve the restore process visibility by adding restore process logs to be accessible from PMM. 

### Components Upgrade

MongoDB exporter has been upgraded to 0.37.0.
