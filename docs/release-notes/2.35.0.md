## Release Highlights

###  Access Control: Limit access to metrics 
!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important/Caution"
    Disclaimer:  PMM Access Control is still technical preview and is subject to change. We recommend that early adopters use this feature for testing purposes only.

We are excited to announce the first step towards PMM Access Management, a highly anticipated solution by our users. PMM now allows you to limit access to metrics, based on labels. This new feature provides a standardized method for granting, changing, and revoking access to metrics. You can now establish policies that control which data can be queried based on specific label criteria with the introduction of label-based access control. It allows you to associate multiple sets of individual Prometheus (Victoria Metics) labels with a policy, ensuring that queries will only return data from series that meet at least one of the defined labels. This provides you with a powerful and flexible way to manage your data and ensure secure access to the information you need. For more information, please visit the Access Control page. 
To ensure a seamless rollout, PMM Access Management will be introduced in phases, taking into consideration your requirements and feedback. Stay tuned for further updates on our roadmap for PMM Access Management.

###  Deploying PMM in k8 with Helm Chart is now generally available
We are thrilled to announce the general availability of deploying PMM in Kubernetes with Helm chart. The deployment of PMM in Kubernetes via Helm chart has been available in Tech Preview since the release of PMM v2.29, and we are now proud to offer it to our users as a supported feature in general availability. For more information, see the  [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/setting-up/server/helm.html).
